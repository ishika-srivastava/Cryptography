This repository contains codes of encryption algorithms in C++ language.

# Cryptography
The prefix “Crypt” means “hidden” and the suffix “Graphy” means “writing”.
Cryptography is a technique of securing information through codes thus preserving Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA Triad).
The methods which are used to protect information are mathematical concepts and algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it difficult to decode them. These algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, and verification to protect data privacy, internet browsing, and confidential transactions such as credit card and debit card transactions. 

# Types of Cryptography
### 1. Symmetric Key Cryptography
   #### - Substitution: One character is replaced by another.
 - Monoalphabetic: The relationship between a character of the plaintext and a character of the ciphertext is one-to-one.
      1. Additive or Shift or Caesar Cipher
      2. Multiplicative Cipher
 - Polyalphabetic: The relationship between a character of the plaintext and a character of the ciphertext is one-to-many.
      1. Autokey Cipher
      2. Playfair Cipher
#### - Transposition: Instead of substitution, the location of characters changes.
### 2. Asymmetric Key Cryptography
### 3. Hash Function



# Applications
- Encrypting or Hashing Passwords
- Secures web browsing
- Digital and cryptocurrencies
- Digital Signature
- Authentication
- End-to-end encryption
